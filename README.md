VuMeter1076 lets you attach the functionality to a subsection of a NeoPixel
string of lights.

Currently it all works very synchonously, so it might be difficult to use
in the presence of a lot of other time sensitive light animations.

But, if you mostly want sound (or other analog sensor) animation, this
should fill the bill.
